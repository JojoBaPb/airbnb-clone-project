🛠️ Technology Stack

This project uses a range of technologies that support performance, modularity, and scalability. Here’s how each one fits in:

    Django: A robust Python web framework that handles routing, models, and application logic.

    Django REST Framework (DRF): Simplifies the creation of REST APIs to handle CRUD operations and user authentication.

    PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for persistent data storage (users, bookings, properties, etc.).

    GraphQL: Enables flexible and precise querying of API data, improving frontend performance.

    Celery: Manages background jobs such as email confirmations and payment processing.

    Redis: Used both as a cache and as a message broker for Celery tasks.

    Docker: Standardizes the environment across development and production using containerization.

    CI/CD Pipelines: Automates testing and deployment processes to ensure consistent and reliable delivery.

🧩 Database Design

Below are the main data entities and their relationships:
🧑‍💼 Users

    id: Primary key

    username, email

    is_host: Boolean flag

    date_joined

Relationships:

    A user may own multiple properties.

    A user may make multiple bookings or leave reviews.

🏠 Properties

    id, title, description

🚀 Feature Breakdown

Each feature replicates essential aspects of Airbnb to provide a complete backend experience.
👤 User Management

Manages account registration, login, and role assignment. Differentiates guests from hosts and supports secure session handling.
🏡 Property Management

Allows hosts to add and manage listings. Listings include details like pricing, location, availability, and description.
📆 Booking System

Enables users to book properties for specific dates, with validations for availability and overlap.
💰 Payment Processing

Processes booking-related payments, logs transactions, and supports asynchronous flows using background tasks.
⭐ Review System

Lets users leave feedback for properties. Ratings and comments contribute to platform transparency and quality control.
📚 API Documentation

Provides standardized API documentation (OpenAPI) for both REST and GraphQL interfaces, simplifying frontend integration.
⚡ Data Optimization

Improves backend efficiency with caching and indexed queries for frequent lookups and filtered data retrieval.
🔐 API Security

Security is integral to protecting sensitive data, enabling trust, and maintaining platform integrity.
✅ Authentication

Secures API endpoints using token-based or session-based login systems. Prevents unauthorized access.
🔒 Authorization

Implements role-based access control. Ensures users can only perform actions permitted to their roles (e.g., only hosts can create listings).
🚫 Rate Limiting

Restricts excessive or abusive API usage. Protects the system from brute-force attacks and spam.
🔐 Data Encryption

Uses HTTPS and hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for secure data transmission and password protection.
🧼 Input Validation

Validates and sanitizes all incoming data. Prevents injection attacks and malformed payloads.
💳 Secure Payment Flows

Integrates with secure gateways and avoids storing sensitive financial data directly.
🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) ensures that every code update is tested and deployed seamlessly. It automates validation, builds, and rollouts to prevent bottlenecks.
Why It’s Valuable

    Quicker releases with automated deployments

    Improved code quality through automated linting and testing

    Reliable updates by detecting errors early

    Better collaboration across teams

Tools in Use

    GitHub Actions: Runs tests and deploys on commits or pull requests.

    Docker: Standardizes environments across dev/staging/prod.

    Celery + Redis: Supports background tasks in production pipelines.

    PostgreSQL: Ensures schema consistency and enables migrations.
